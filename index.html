                        <h3>
                        I grew up and currently reside in Mount Vernon, WA. A small city 60 miles north of Seattle, WA. I have 3 cats, 2 dogs, and 2 rabbits.
                        I also have 4 siblings, 3 older than me, 1 younger.
                        I was homeschooled my entire childhood, so college was my first formal classroom experience. Add Covid on top of that, and I have still never
                        attended a traditional in person class. I started pursueing a Nursing degree from Skagit Valley college in January 2021.
                        But I want to take you back to when I moved out from my parents house. I was 19, and they decided to move to Idaho. I had 2 jobs at the time,
                        I worked at Starbucks as a Barista, and at Urban Fitness as a Personal Trainer. I took their move as an opportunity to move out and pursue my own path.

                        <h3>
                            I stayed in Skagit Valley, and pursued Personal Training. Well after a number of hurdles, and just not being a good salesman, I quit my job, and was sleeping
                            in my car (Nissan Versa... lol). So things hadn't worked out for me, and I knew I needed a change. So I followed in my older brothers footsteps,
                            and joined the Air Force. I served 4 years as a military police officer. I found my footing, and was in a much better place. I got deployed to Kuwait,
                            and while I was there I started dating my (now) wife. I had met her years prior in Mount Vernon before joining the military.
                            After my service ended, I came back to Mount Vernon and started college. I currently work as a CNA (Nursing assistant) at Skagit Valley Hospital.
                            The healthcare field wasn't panning out to be what I'd hope as my career, so I started exploring different options, and something made me reach out 
                            to some programmer friends of mine. They recommended CodeFellows specifically, and talked me through what their work days are like.
                            So here I am, climbing through this course, hoping the excitment I have for this field continues, and I can graduate in Febuary and land a successful
                            coding job.
